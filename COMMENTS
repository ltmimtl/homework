slcsp/
------------------------
To run, simply:

`ruby slcsp.rb`

NOTES:

The script is idempotent and the results are written to slcsp.csv.

This is all done in memory, which would not scale for large datasets
or datasets of undetermined size, but otherwise works quite well for
this particular type of scenario.

Assumptions regarding edge/nil cases:
* zero or more than one rate area per zip
* no silver plans in rate area
* only one silver plan in rate area with a unique rate (i.e. no second lowest)
